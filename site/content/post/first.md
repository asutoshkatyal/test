# NSM 
## We're currently on Summer break: We will resume in mid-August

The Open (-Source) Network Security Monitoring Group (OpenNSM) meets at 6:00 CST on Mondays. 
We're not aware of any other active NSM user groups in the United States, and have the ambitious goal of being a premier place for students, professionals, and hobbyists, from all over to share their research, tools, and techniques in a laid back and friendly environment.

OpenNSM aims to provide a place for network security analysts and those interested in information security to share tricks, solutions, work on projects, and other knowledge about the subject. Come join us!

## Areas of focus:

The Bro Programming Language
Libpcap programming
Writing IDS Signatures
Packet Analysis
Log Analysis
Malware Analysis
IDS and Firewall Evasion Techniques
SecurityOnion Enhancements
Much more!
